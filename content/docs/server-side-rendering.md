Whoopsie, I haven't got round to writing this guide yet. If you haven't checked
out the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) that is probably the best place to
go to get up to speed.

If you have any questions, feel free to ping `@hayleigh.dev` over on the Gleam
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy) and I'd be happy to help you out!
